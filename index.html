<h2>I am Ananth</h2>
<body>
<p>my name is ananth. i am 14 years old and i live in Doha, Qatar. the weather in doha right now is very sunny nd dry, so we sit inside until the evenings.</p>
<p> in the evenings i like to go out and cycle with my friends. the neighbourhood i live in is very friendly, and i have made a lot of friends. </p>
<p><mark>my hobbies are: <list>singing, swimming, playing keyboard and playing some sports.</list></mark></p>

my favourite quote is:<blockquote>"If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the
music which he hears, however measured or far away".</blockquote>
